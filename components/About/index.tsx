        I first started working with software engineering tools in 1998 as a
        hobbyist. My first programming experience was with Microsoft Visual
        Basic, and C++. I started working with web technology in 2001, and
        published my first PHP-Nuke CMS powered website in 2003.

        Since 2003: I have created numerous web applications, user interfaces,
        web APIs, and software packages. I have spent hundreds of hours
        contributing to open source software, and have published multiple
        pieces of open-source software. My first public open-source
        contribution was published on SourceForge in 2006.
